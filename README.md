    - Click the "Convert Text" button to convert the text to the Sakal Bharati format.
    - The converted text will appear in the output text area.

## Supported Voice Input Languages

- English (US)
- Tamil (India)
- Telugu (India)
- Kannada (India)
- Malayalam (India)
- Hindi (India)

You can easily add more languages by editing the `<option>` elements inside the language selection dropdown in the `index.html` file.

## Compatibility

- The app works best in **Google Chrome** as it supports the Web Speech API (`webkitSpeechRecognition`).
- Make sure you are connected to the internet to use the speech recognition feature, as it requires server-side processing from Google's Web Speech API.
- Ensure microphone permissions are enabled for speech recognition to function properly.

## Troubleshooting

- **Speech recognition not working**:
    - Make sure you're using Google Chrome and have a stable internet connection.
    - Ensure that microphone permissions are granted in your browser settings.
    - Speech recognition requires HTTPS. If you're testing locally, use a tool like `ngrok` to serve your app over HTTPS.

- **Speech recognition error: network**:
    - This error occurs if the browser cannot connect to Google's servers. Make sure you are connected to the internet, and that your network allows access to external APIs.
